# Definition

_Let cr(G) denote the standard crossing number of a graph G, i.e. the minimum number of crossings of its edges over all possible drawings of G in the plane. For k⩾2, define the k-planar crossing number as..._

_ And let the thickness of the planar graphs G be expressed as..._

Trivally we have

The (graph-theoretical) thickness is now known for all complete graphs [1,
2, 3, 12, 13], and is given by the following formula:

## Conjecture
There is known formula to be true for n at most 10 (see [G]). I believe it is also known to hold for n at most 12

This conjectured crossing number is known to be an upper bound. This is shown by exhibiting a drawing with the desired number of crossings.
